Precision is very important as some things cant work without percice sets of numbers that could be detremental to making things work. 
Steps or details missing in coding can cause many errors and problems that could lead to problems that were not there before. 
Attention to detail can make the difference in something working or something falling apart so adding attention to detail could be a very helpful thing for some problems.

computer science is very important for the games i wanna play after i go home from school/work, people need to keep up on the games and things constantly break so they have to use computer science to fix it all.

the most enjoyable part of the class is the free pacing we can do from slow to faster if needed, ive seen nothing that needs to be improved, theres not a lot ive been wanting to find out about and i have been trying to think about other subjects to look into while here, i am not that interested in pursuing any further certifications that may relate to this class.

i do think that ai can be very helpful and something great to use at times but i dont think we should slow down normal tech roles for only ai, i do think ai could be useful but we also need to continue finding more and more before diving deep into only ai work, now i do think ai can have small bad sides but i dont think its in any current situation that i know of that could be causing many issues.
